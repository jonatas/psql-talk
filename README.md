# The Zen life in the terminal

This is the repo for the talk at [PGConf Brazil 2022](https://www.pgconf.com.br/2022/).

The slides are at [slides.md](slides.md). I used the vim editor with the [presenting](https://github.com/sotte/presenting.vim) plugin.

The talk is in portuguese and most part of the examples I walked through are also in the [script.md](script.md).
